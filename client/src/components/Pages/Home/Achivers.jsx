sounds fake, looks fake and we all know the reality as well.
Let's not waste much time talking about, it verifying it, justifying or defaming that. 
I have something better for you :)
This time of year have festivals every day. Every day is something new and I am pretty sure that you all know about them and you are going to celebrate them with joy for sure !!
But, I have a new festival for coders preparing for interview !!
Yeah, a special festival for coders to help them ace interviews.
GeeksforGeeks is organising a weekly recurring contest series which will have interview questions from Google, Amazon, Adobe, Paytm etc.
- Do you know why interviews are hard?
Just because they are time bounded and we have to solve problems quickly with optimisations. 
You will be able to practice the same environment in these contests since they are time bounded and have real interview problems.
- Why Do Most of the people hate Contests?
Because they are unable to upsolve the problems. For this GFG will go live after every contest to discuss the problems !!!!
There are a lot more than what I just have discussed
Participate in every contest, every Sunday at 7PM IST
Itâ€™s me in the pic still looking at you scrolling LinkedIn instead of registering for this supercool interview series.
What are you waiting for?
Link is present in the first comment :)

                I had no idea what placements mean till my 5th semester in college.

I started preparing for placements in my 6th semester.

My dream company in college was SAP Labs and I stopped preparing after getting placed in it.

I applied to Amazon just to get an interview experience of the tech giant.

I wasn't aware of Leetcode(I knew GFG) when I gave my interview at Amazon.

I had only academic projects in my resume when I got placed at Amazon.

I thought 1000 times before accepting Amazon offer because of the reviews I had read.
It's been around 2 years at Amazon now and I haven't regretted my decision of joining.

Sometimes, unexpected things do happen!! Not everything can be well planned and not everything goes as per plan(some things are just out of our control), learn to go with the flow.
